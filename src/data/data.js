            BookHub is a personal project based on a client-server architecture. 
            The app uses the Open Library API to fetch book data and implement 
            search features. Users can search up books, record dates, ratings, 
            and reviews, and add booklogs to a book list. There is an integrated
            point reward system to encourage users to log in and explore more books.

      <p className='about-text fs-9'>As a constantly evolving field of study, there
        are endless things to explore and do! From my fingertips, I can create positive 
        impact that can reach the other ends of the world. Isn't that mindbending?

      <p className='about-text fw-6 fs-16'>What has Emma been cooking on?</p>
      <p className='about-text fs-9'>These past two years, I've worked on two research
        projects! In 2022, I've worked as part of UW SEAL's Arduinos sensor team where I've
        worked on improving the COVID-19 proximity sensor and wrote the NSPIRES proposal
        document. In 2023 till now, I've worked on the UW Mobile Intelligence Lab where I 
        built an iOS app using neural networks to identify target speech from noisy environments.
      </p>
      <p className='about-text fs-9'>I work as the Graphics Executive Officer on UW COM^2, 
        the biggest CS RSO on campus! You can check out my graphics

      <p className='about-text fs-9'>I will also be a teaching assistant for UW this upcoming fall

      <p className='about-text fw-6 fs-16'>What else does Emma do?</p>
      <p className='about-text fs-9'>Other than cooking up some code, I enjoy trips, 
        snowboarding, hiking, gaming, and food ventures with friends. I am a certified coffee addict (starbucks
        loves me and I love starbucks). On top of that, my love for music knows
        no bounds (check out my

        I love experimenting with new things, going on full send, thinking deep thoughts, and making
        life as fun as it can possibly get
